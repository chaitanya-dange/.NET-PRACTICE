@* In Razor views, the @ symbol is used to indicate the start of a code block. It is used to embed server-side code in the HTML of a view.

In the code you provided, the @ symbol is used in several places:

At the top of the view, it is used to start a code block where the value of the ViewData dictionary is set.
In the C# code block in the middle of the view, it is used to start each line of code.
In the foreach loop, it is used to start the loop and to output the value of the flwr variable as an HTML list item.
The @ symbol is used to switch the view parser between HTML and C#. Without it, the parser would treat the C# code as HTML and would display the code as a string on the page. *@
