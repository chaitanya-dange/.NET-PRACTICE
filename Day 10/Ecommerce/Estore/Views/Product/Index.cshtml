@* NOTE A :In the code you provided, the this.ViewData property is used to store a list of products in the view data dictionary.

The view data dictionary is an object that allows you to pass data from a controller action to a view template.
 It is a key-value store that is available to the view template during rendering, and can be accessed using the ViewData property of the view.

In the code you provided, the ViewData property is accessed using the this keyword, which refers to the current instance of the controller. 
The ViewData property is then used to store the allProducts list in a key-value pair, with the key "products" and the value being the list of products. *@
